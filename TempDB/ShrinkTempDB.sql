although at the expense of your cached execution plans, 
which will need to be rebuilt the next time. 
This means that ad-hoc queries and stored procedures will have 
to recompile the next time you run them. 

Although this happens automatically, you may notice a significant 
performance decrease the first few times you run your procedures.

/*
DBCC SHRINKFILE is the same tool used to shrink any database file, 
in tempdb or other databases. 
This is the step that actually frees the unallocated space from 
the database file.

Warning: Make sure you don’t have any open transactions when running 
DBCC SHRINKFILE. 
Open transactions may cause the DBCC operation to fail, 
and possibly corrupt your tempdb!
