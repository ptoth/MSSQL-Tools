# 1. Your server doesn't take longer than 10 seconds to start, 
# otherwise modify the sleep line (or just do this manually and wait for it to start) 

# 2. You already have an account with access on the server. 
# If you don't you can add it or just reset the SA password. 
# I find that usually the people interested in doing this 
# at least have access to a database on the server so 
# you can just grant that group admin access for the duration of the recovery. 

# 3. You don't mind killing the sql server task ungracefully like I'm doing below. 
# If you do mind that, you can always just do 
# all this one step at a time instead of 
# copy and pasting it or something. 

# 4. You're server binary is in Q:\MSSQL\MSSQL.9999\MSSQL\Binn\sqlservr. 
# I assume that yours is not which is why I am using this 
# in the script so change the path to wherever yoru sqlservr.exe is actually located. 

# 5. You already had sql agent running. 
# If you didn't, you can drop the last line.
# If you did the first line will automatically end it with the /y
