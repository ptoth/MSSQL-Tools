VERSION:    2016-06-16

DESCRIPTION: This procedure will insert a blob of table rows, generated
			with SELECT ... FOR XML AUTO into all of the respective tables
			referenced. If possible, it will figure out the insert order,
			based on foreign key constraints between those tables, and it
			also gives you the option of first deleting any existing rows
			and/or using IDENTITY_INSERT.
			Typical use case: scripting and copying meta-data from multiple
			related tables from a production database to a test/dev database.

USAGE:      --- 1. Collect one or more tables' contents as an XML AUTO blob:
            DECLARE @xml xml=(
                SELECT (SELECT * FROM dbo.A FOR XML AUTO, TYPE),
                       (SELECT * FROM dbo.B FOR XML AUTO, TYPE),
                       (SELECT * FROM dbo.C FOR XML AUTO, TYPE)
                FOR XML PATH(''));

            --- 2. Then, on the target database (with identical, existing tables),
            ---    run the procedure, passing the XML blob as argument:
            EXECUTE dbo.LoadTableBlobs
            	@blob=@xml,
            	@use_identity_insert=0,  --- If you need IDENTITY_INSERT ON
            	@truncate_table=0,       --- If you want to empty the target table(s) before inserting
            	@print_only=0            --- If you want a "dry run" that only prints the T-SQL code
